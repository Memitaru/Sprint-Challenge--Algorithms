#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) runtime will grow in a linear fashion with n


b) The outer loop will run n times. Inside of the while loop j is increasing each iteration. The while loop is O(log n).

Multiply those together because they are nested loops and it will be O(n log n)


c) Runtime goes up in a linear fashion with n. O(n)
